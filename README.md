Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. It is a simple tool to record, delete or update contacts. The main goal is to improve my coding skills. I encourage you to test the functionality and have some fun with it.

Please note that as I am currently using free tiers of cloud-based services, the project may take longer to load or respond at times. Due to these limitations, there may be instances where the app communicates with the database and shows errors. In such cases, it is recommended that you reload the page to obtain the expected result. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I work on improving my coding skills.

I've used various technologies such as Python, Flask, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, MySql, PlanetScale MySQL serverless database, and Render to deploy the application from Github.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to provide any feedback you may have.
