Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. This is a personal website to showcase my software development projects. 

One of the projects is a phone book app to save phone numbers and names. The application is a straightforward tool designed to add, remove, or modify contact information. One of the features of this app is that when you enter a new contact's name, the app automatically creates a section for it, with the first letter of the name as the heading. It is a stand alone project and the aim is to learn how to build those features to use them in a more complex project I have on my mind. The password is salted and hashed to encrypt and protect it from being easily read by strangers. The main goal is to improve my coding skills. I encourage you to try it to test the functionality.

I've used various technologies such as Python, Flask, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, MySql, Amazon RDS database, and Render to deploy the application from Github.

Thank you for your interest, and feel free to provide any feedback you may have.
